### Features
- **Welcome Message**: Provides an initial greeting and a brief overview of the scriptâ€™s functionality.
- **User Authentication**: Displays the current user executing the script and prompts for confirmation to proceed.
- **Network Interface Detection**: Identifies an active network interface (ensure only one connection/ethernet cable is plugged in).
- **Current Network Settings**: Retrieves and displays the current IP address, netmask, gateway, and checks the status of DHCP4 and DHCP6.
- **User Input Prompts**: Prompts the user to enter a new static IP, netmask, gateway, DNS servers, and hostname.
- **Netplan Configuration Management**: Locates the existing netplan configuration file, creates a backup, and generates a new configuration file based on user input.
